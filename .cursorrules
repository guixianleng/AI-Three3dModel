Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate React examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Key Conventions
- Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
- Use Pinia for state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Utilize Nuxt's auto-imports feature for components and composables.


Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; avoid options API.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, composables, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., AuthWizard.vue).
- Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useAuthState.ts).

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
- Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging defineComponent and PropType.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use template syntax for declarative rendering.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn Vue, and Uno CSS for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Uno CSS;

Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices
- Use <script setup lang="ts"> syntax for concise component definitions.
- Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
- Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
- Implement custom composables for reusable logic.
